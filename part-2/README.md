# HTML Tutorial (part 2)

The goal of this second part is to give a structure to our website.
Create a website with the following pages:

* Home
* About
* Contact
* Resources

All these pages will have an header with a logo and a menu.
Then there is a content area and a sidebar menu (not present in the home page).
Finally a footer for less important information.

## Home Page

The home page in the content area will have a slider and three buttons for
the three main topics of the website:

* Stories
* Drawings
* Sports

Then an area for the welcome message and the Bio.

## About page

The content area will have a photo and some personal Bio information. The
siderbar will be available.

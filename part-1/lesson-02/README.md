# Lesson 2 - The headlines

To give a structure to your documents using chapters, section, sub sections, and so on you can use the headlines elements. HTML document allows you to create a hierarchy up to 6 levels. As a best practice (it is not mandatory) there should be only one H1 tag for a web page. You can have multiple tags for all the other levels.

```
...
<body>
    <h1>My 1st level headline</h1>
    <h2>My 2nd level headline</h2>
    <h3>My 3rd level headline</h3>
    <h4>My 4th level headline</h4>
    <h5>My 5th level headline</h5>
    <h6>My 6th level headline</h6>
</body>
...
```

# Lesson 2 - The headlines

To give a structure to your documents using chiapters, section, sub sections, and so on you can use the header tags. HTML document allows you to create a hierarchy up to 6 levels. As a best practice (it is not mandatory) there should be only one H1 tag for a web page. You can have multiple tags for all the other levels.

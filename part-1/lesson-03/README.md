    <h1>Dragon Ball's story</h1>
    <p>
        The Dragon Ball story takes place mostly on Earth, but some
        humans look "normal", others are "intelligent animals"
        (for example the king of the world is a dog), some people live in conditions
        quite primitive, others with quite advanced technology,
        dinosaurs are not extinct, but they are found in places where no people live
        (usually).

# Lesson 7 - Improve paragraph readibility

As a best practice use paragraphs with max 4/5 lines. This will improve the text readibility. Moreover, you can start adding bold, italic, underline text. Here the HTML tags to do that:

* **BOLD**, ```<b> ... </b>``` or ```<strong> ... </strong>```
* _ITALIC_, ```<i> ... </i>``` or ```<em> ... </em>```
* UNDERLINE, ```<u> ... </u>```

# Lesson 1 - Your first HTML document

This is your first HTML document. HTML is a SGML grammar and the tag ```DOCTYPE``` specify the document type. The ```html``` tags define the start and the end of the HTML document. A tag can have one or more attributes, in this case the `the ```lang``` attribute defines the document language. HTML has two parts: header and body. In the header you can put everything required to describe the document included the title. This title will appear in the tab of your browser. The body contains the document body.

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
    <head>
        <title>My Document Title</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        Hello World!
    </body>
</html>
```

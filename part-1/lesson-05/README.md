# Lesson 5 - Add a second paragraph

In an HTML paragraph if you leave a blank line it is not rendered in the web page. To separate paragraphs you simply need to add more content in the tags ```<p> ... </p>```. If you want more spaces between paragraphs you can add an empty paragraph tag ```<p/>```. Here an example:

```
<body>
    <h1>Dragon Ball's story</h1>
    <p>
        The Dragon Ball story takes place mostly on Earth, but some
        humans look "normal", others are "intelligent animals"
        ...
    </p>
    <h2>Dragon Ball</h2>
    <p>
        Goku is a child who lives alone in a secluded cottage in the mountains, ha
        incredible physical strength, has a tail and has a magic stick that stretches
        on command.
        ...
    </p>
    <p/>
    <p>
        Goku goes to train at the Turtle Hermit with another student, Krillin.
        ..
    </p>
</body>

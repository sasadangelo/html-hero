        <h1>Dragon Ball Story</h1>
        <p>
            The story of Dragon Ball takes place mainly on Earth, but some humans have 
            a "normal" appearance, others are "intelligent animals" (for example, the 
            King Furry is a dog), some people live in fairly primitive conditions, others 
            with a fairly advanced technology, dinosaurs are not extinct, but are found 
            in places where people do not live (usually).

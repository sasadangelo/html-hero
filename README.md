# HTML from beginner to hero

This is a project I created to teach programming to my twelve years old kid. My son started few years ago to play with Scratch and Kodu to create small video game but I wanted to teach him more about programming. Classical programming languages like C, C++, Java, Python are to complex for him. He loves writing stories with Open Office so I thought start from HTML and CSS to publish his stories on Internet could be a good start point. From that point, the programming journey can continue with Javascript, PHP and so on.

The tutorial is divided in three parts. The first part is a website with few pages linked each other, its goal is to show the basic of HTML and CSS. The second part show how to structure a website with header, logo, menu, sliders, siderbars, footer, and the use of classical website page like About, Contact, Resources pages. The third part is more on graphical aspect, it in we will focus on give some style to the website and improve its look and feel.

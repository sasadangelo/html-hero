# HTML from beginner to hero

This is a project I created to teach programming to my twelve years old kid. My son started few years ago to play with Scratch and Kodu to create small video game but I wanted to teach him more about programming. Classical programming languages like C, C++, Java, Python were to complex for him. He loves writing stories with Open Office so I thought start from HTML to publish his stories on Internet could be a good start point. From that the programming journey can continue with CSS, Javascript, PHP and so on.
